## Description

Still Good is a product tracking tool, designed to remedy your wasteful habits or curate your existing flow of perishable items. The idea is to support budget-conscious or waste-conscious people in their missions to move products from store to consumed by the expiration dates.

**Project Requirements:**
* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
